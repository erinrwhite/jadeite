*Improvised standing desk: file holder, old books, magazine holders, two shelves*

I got crafty last week and decided to see if I could make a standing desk from found materials around my office. The result was pretty cool, and so far I’m enjoying testing it out.

Ingredients:

- **base of monitor stand:** 1 plastic stacking file crate from Staples I’d been using for recycling</span>
- **table for monitor stand:** a shelf from my (mostly-empty) office bookshelf
- **base of keyboard/mouse stand:** textbooks and yellow pages from 6 years ago, shoved into magazine holders for structural integrity
- **table for keyboard/mouse stand:** another shelf (from my boss’s bookshelf)

…and that’s it. I don’t think this will be a forever desk, but it’s fun to try out for now. I do know I will need an anti-fatigue mat to stand on, which [apparently is a gamechanger](http://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2012/11/20/ikea-stand-up-desk-two-months-later/).

Down the road I’m hoping we’ll get pneumatic, easily-adjustable desks a la [GeekDesk](http://www.geekdesk.com/). In the short term, though, this is a good way to figure out if a standing desk will work for me.

**Update 4/17:** I’m still standing. The first few weeks were rough – the concrete floors were not very forgiving and I was having pain in my feet and back at the end of most days. In mid-March I got an anti-fatigue mat (a 2′ x 3′, 7/8″ thick [mat from SitBetter](http://www.sitbetter.com/view/chair/rnm-pm2436/ranco-pyra-2'-x-3'-anti-fatigue-mat/)) that has made all the difference.

The mat’s super-comfy and supports standing for long periods of time. I’ve been standing at my desk all day and only sitting for meetings. On days without meetings I am standing to 8 hours comfortably.

Also: I subscribed to the base-level Spotify account and have found myself dancing at my desk.

I’ve loved this change of pace and don’t see myself returning to a seated desk any time soon.
