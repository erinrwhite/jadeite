After a long break from participating in a bike challenge, I’m returning this year! [New city](/a-bit-of-an-update/), new bikes, same me, same ol’ silly bike tricks. After chatting with some coworkers on Slack about [randonneuring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randonneuring), I remembered that [Chasing Mailboxes sponsors bike challenges](https://chasingmailboxes.com/2024/09/30/coffeeneuring-challenge-2024-the-year-of-small-wins/) – and lo and behold, another one was starting that week!

## WTF is coffeeneuring?

A riff on randonneuring, coffeeneuring is, at its core, riding your bike to drink coffee. This year’s challenge was as follows:

> Between October 6 through November 18, 2024:
> 
> - ride your bike 7 times,
> - to at least 6 different places
> - at least 2 miles round trip every time
> - drink 7 total cups of coffee (or another fall-type beverage),
> - and document your coffeeneuring

I’ve done similar challenges in past years:

- [2014 Errandonnee challenge]({{site.baseurl}}/errandonnee-winter-bike-challenge/)
- [2016 Errandonnee challenge]({{site.baseurl}}/2016-errandonnee-challenge-handled-it/)

## The rides

*Lil’ City Ripper.*

1. **October 5: over/under long way to a short way home.** 12.8 miles on the City Ripper. Out to India point and back to New Harvest coffee for a maple pecan cold brew. Looooots of meandering, wandering, going over and under bridges.
2. **October 6: west end winder.** 8.5 miles on the Ripper and my first time at Long Live Beerworks. I enjoyed a lil’ taster of their Oktoberfest.
3. **October 18: bike to (co)work day.** 4 miles on the ebike. Another workday at my coworking space in Olneyville. Enjoyed a large mug of drip coffee during my morning meetings.
4. **October 20: idyllic Riverside rambler.** 12 miles on the City Ripper. Another stunning Saturday in Rhode Island. I drove to the East Providence parking lot to hopped on the East Bay bike path down to Riverside. Saw a yacht rock cover band playing near the water, stuffed some crab cakes in my face, and enjoyed a cortado on the patio at Borealis cofee.
5. **October 26: secret coffee shop visit with Jeremy.** 3.6 miles on the City Ripper down to Olneyville. Enjoyed an Americano while catching up with Jeremy and gazing out over the Woonasquatucket River.
6. **November 10: Woonasquatucket bike path to Moniker Brewery.** 10 miles on the ebike. Took the long way around on the Woony bike path in the waning daylight. Enjoyed a smoked helles and a book.
7. **November 18: quick lunchtime jaunt to new coffee place Reprise in the West End.** 4.4 miles and a cortado. My first ride as a 40-year old and I felt way too old for this cool new coffee shop crowd. #influencing?

## Reflections

1. **External pressure motivates me.** The weather has been far too mild (thanks, climate change!) and far too dry, which means I would’ve been out on my bike a lot anyway in this unseasonably pleasant weather. But this challenge gave me the extra motivation to leave the house and go for a ride.
2. **The Woony abides.** Throughout this ride, I really got to see the quick progress being made on the newest part of the [Woonasquatucket River Greenway](https://wrwc.org/portfolio/kinsley-avenue-promenade-street-greenway-project/), which is a key component of my route anywhere east of our neighborhood (i.e. most of the city). I am very excited to see this work nearing completion!
3. **Riding bikes makes me happy.** I did my first errandonnee the year I turned 30. I turned 40 this past week, and lots has changed in 10 years, but this one thing has remained the same. I am feeling grateful to be able to ride, and to have such good infrastructure to make it far more fun.

See you next year.
