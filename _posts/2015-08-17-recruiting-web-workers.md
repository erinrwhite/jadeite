In the past few years I’ve created a couple of part-time, then full-time, staff positions on the web team at VCU Libraries. We now have a web designer and a web developer who’ve both been with us for a while, but for a few years it was a revolving door of hires. So let’s just say I’ve hired lots of folks in just a few years as a manager.

A colleague from another library emailed a few weeks ago asking for tips on how to recruit talented web workers for a library web developer position. Here are some things I’ve done to get people in the door.

1. **Advertise** **on [jobs.code4lib.org](http://jobs.code4lib.org/)** – these jobs are automatically forwarded to the code4lib listserv. Those listserv subscribers tend to tweet interesting jobs out as well.
2. **Advertise on non-library job websites** including Craigslist (lots of spam but talented people too); and consider paying to advertise on LinkedIn and other tech job sites.
3. **Post the salary**, both on the code4lib site and on your organization’s jobs site – even if it’s just a range or a minimum.
4. **Indicate some of the big projects** you’d like the person to work on – where you would see this person contributing right away. Whet the appetite: “How can I grow? How can I help this organization grow?”
5. **Note your current tech stack.** Are you developing your own web applications? Managing your own server? Using PHP, Ruby on Rails, Ember, Node?
6. **Sell the non-salary benefits.** Advocate for and advertise soft benefits that tend to go a long way with digital folks: 
    - telecommuting – a day a week minimum;
    - dedicated time and administrative support for working on innovative projects – bonus if it’s built into the official job description;
    - support for travel/training;
    - flexible hours;
    - 40-hour workweek – sadly, in the U.S. this is a perk;
    - all other non-salary benefits of working for a higher ed, government or nonprofit institution: retirement, tuition remission, gym membership, etc.?
7. **Sell the mission.** Some people are tired of working for the bottom line and want to do work that matters. Libraries help people. Our work matters.
8. **Longer-term: get out there.** If you are a web worker yourself, get involved in local web meetups, professional groups, etc., and meet people in your community of practice. This serves a couple of purposes beyond helping with your own learning: it expands the network of people you can reach out to when you’re hiring, and it gives your library some cred as a place to work.
