<div style="float: right;">[![Errandonnee 2016](https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1581/26014456471_6a8da042dc_n.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/conformerist/albums/72157666395808566 "Errandonnee 2016")<script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js"></script></div>After being foiled by a long trip last year, I got the chance to attempt the [Errandonnee challenge](http://chasingmailboxes.com/2016/02/25/the-errandonnee-ride-or-run-and-get-stuff-done/) again this year (I [attempted it in 2014](https://erinrwhite.com/errandonnee-winter-bike-challenge/), too). The challenge: complete 12 errands in 12 days and ride or run a total of 30 miles between March 4-15, 2016.

Fun twist: I was in Philadelphia and bikeless from Sunday, March 6-Thursday, March 10.

And yet: 12 errands, 6 distinct days, 61.4 miles. My bike was my old reliable, a [2012 Surly Cross-Check](https://www.flickr.com/photos/conformerist/24069358253/) to which I’ve pledged my undying love.

Anyhow, here’s how the 12 errands shook out.

**March 4**

1. Commute – 2.8 miles – learned that Strava is cool. My first time using the app.
2. Social call – Asado – 1.7 miles – observed crazy traffic and learned to keep breathing, no need to rush.
3. Social call – Erin’s house – 2.4 miles – learned that Grace Street’s cobbles last a lot longer than I thought.
4. Arts/Entertainment – Lucy Dacus at the Broadberry – 2.7 miles – heard a really great cover of “Dancin’ in the Dark”. Learned that Richmond needs more bike parking infrastructure.

**March 5**

5. <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Shopping – Ellwoods – 2.2 miles – learned that I can eat a coconut macaroon in a disgusting record time.</span>
6. You carried WHAT??? – Woodland Heights and back – 7.6 miles – learned that I can probably hold 6 or 7 irons in my bag (only carried 1 this time). Also, the James is beautiful and I wouldn’t mind seeing it every day.

**March 10**

7. Personal care: group ride with [Bike!Bike! Southeast](http://ragandbonesrva.org/bikebike-se-2016/) – 12.1 miles – observed some beautiful city views and met the folks from a bike co-op in West Virginia. It was warm and the group was big (maybe 40 people). Great way to get back on the bike after a few days away.

**March 11**

8. Commute one way – 1.4 miles – observed some extra traffic on the highway. Smooth sailing on the side streets.
9. Personal care – 2.4 miles – dinner with a friend after a long week. Learned that it takes an equal amount of time to get to Sticky Rice from VCU in a car or on a bike.

**March 12**

10. Wild Card: Bike!Bike! Southeast Scavenger Hunt – 13.4 miles – learned a lot more about some of our city streets and how to win at Mario video games. Super fun.

**March 13**

11. Store: Carytown Bikes by way of Hardywood – 4.5 miles – learned about a new anti-concussion helmet liner technology called [MIPS](http://www.mips.technology/) and got John a helmet.
12. Wild card: Sunday afternoon roundabout – 8.2 miles – another afternoon spent entirely on the bike. Learned that 30% chance of rain sometimes means 100% chance of rain. Whoops!

## Reflections

A couple years ago [I reflected](https://erinrwhite.com/errandonnee-winter-bike-challenge/) on how much more this challenge got me out on my bike. This year, I was really just recording the stuff I was doing on my bike anyway. It is truly a luxury to be able to bike everywhere, and I am grateful every day for it.
