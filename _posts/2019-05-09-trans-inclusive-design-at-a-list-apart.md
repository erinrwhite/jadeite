I am thrilled and terrified to say that I have an article on [Trans-inclusive design](https://alistapart.com/article/trans-inclusive-design/ "Trans-inclusive design") out on A List Apart today.

I have read A List Apart for years and have always seen it as The Site for folks who make websites, so it is an honor to be published there.
