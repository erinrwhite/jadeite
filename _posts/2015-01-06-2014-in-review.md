2014 was a big, brag-worthy year for me:

- Started writing again ([about bikes](https://erinrwhite.com/errandonnee-winter-bike-challenge/), natch).
- Met my [internet hero](http://www.zephoria.org/).
- Ran a 10k, then a half-marathon.
- [Did some work and wrote about it](https://erinrwhite.com/category/libraries/) (just on this blog, but a start).
- Gave new grads some [advice](http://rvanews.com/features/advice-for-soon-to-be-college-grads/111934).
- Created a [code of conduct](http://eduiconf.org/introducing-the-edui-code-of-conduct/) for the conference I help organize.
- Rode my bike all over Richmond, greater Virginia, and five other states, through the [Greenbrier River Trail in WV](https://www.flickr.com/photos/conformerist/sets/72157644734025073/), and from [Pittsburgh to Washington, DC](https://www.flickr.com/photos/conformerist/sets/72157648015937770/).
- Got cited in a dang [book](http://www.alastore.ala.org/detail.aspx?ID=11177)!
- [Made music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz4_ell8-Os) (just once, but a start).
- Half-assedly started a [Tumblr to document my obsession with beautiful bikes](http://bikesofrva.tumblr.com/).
- Fell in love.
- [Hiked overnight](https://www.flickr.com/photos/conformerist/sets/72157644734025073/) on the Appalachian Trail with an old friend.
- [Threw myself a big birthday party](http://erinsnerdythirty.tumblr.com/) and invited a bunch of people I love.
- Traveled all over, celebrated birthdays, cried at weddings, and saw many wonderful friends and family.

Hereâ€™s to keeping up the momentum in 2015.
