2014 was a big, brag-worthy year for me:

- Started writing again ([about bikes]({{site.baseurl}}errandonnee-winter-bike-challenge/), natch).
- Met my [internet hero](http://www.zephoria.org/).
- Ran a 10k, then a half-marathon.
- [Did some work and wrote about it]({{site.baseurl}}tag/libraries/) (just on this blog, but a start).
- Gave new grads some [advice](http://rvanews.com/features/advice-for-soon-to-be-college-grads/111934).
- Created a [code of conduct](https://web.archive.org/web/20141024125404/http://eduiconf.org/code-of-conduct/) for the conference I help organize.
- Rode my bike all over Richmond, greater Virginia, and five other states, through the [Greenbrier River Trail in WV](https://www.greenbrierrivertrail.com/), and from [Pittsburgh to Washington, DC](https://bikecando.com/).
- Got cited in a dang [book](https://alastore.ala.org/content/putting-user-first-30-strategies-transforming-library-services)!
- [Made music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz4_ell8-Os) (just once, but a start).
- Half-assedly started a [Tumblr to document my obsession with beautiful bikes](http://bikesofrva.tumblr.com/).
- Fell in love.
- Hiked overnight on the Appalachian Trail with an old friend.
- [Threw myself a big birthday party](http://erinsnerdythirty.tumblr.com/) and invited a bunch of people I love.
- Traveled all over, celebrated birthdays, cried at weddings, and saw many wonderful friends and family.

Here’s to keeping up the momentum in 2015.
