In an effort to certify my bike nerditude, I’m participating in [Chasing Mailboxes DC’s winter errandonnee challenge](http://chasingmailboxes.com/2014/03/04/winter-challenge-the-errandonnee-2014-edition/):

> Errandonnee: Complete 12 errands in 12′ish days and ride a total of 30 miles by bike between March 7-19, 2014.\*

I’m joining the challenge a few days after the official start date but am confident I can make it happen. I don’t know if anyone else in Richmond is participating, but there are lots of [inspiring updates so far](http://chasingmailboxes.com/2014/03/12/errandonnee-roundup/) from all over.

This challenge is exciting to me because even though I primarily travel on two wheels, it gives me an excuse to explore even more of my city and share it with others. I love the cycling community and this is a neat way to connect.

1. **3/11 – personal health ride:** Mental health cruise through beautiful Richmond on a 70-degree night. Rode through VCU, around Oregon Hill, down to the Capitol and Back. Bright-ass headlight and blinky-ass taillight used to show the way. *9.5 miles.*
2. **3/12 – work:** commute to work (does this also count as a “library” errand since I’m a librarian?) *3.6 miles.*
3. **3/12 – groceries:** rolled down to Ellwood Thompson’s for some groceries. *1.4 miles.*
4. **3/13 – wild card:** biked through some of the strongest wind gusts I’ve yet seen to my 9 a. m. meeting on the medical campus. *5.9 miles.*
5. **3/14 – coffee:** started my morning early with a trip to lamplighter. *1.6 miles.*
6. **3/15 – community meeting (kinda – more like a conference):** biked to [THATcamp New Souths](http://newsouths2014.thatcamp.org/). *3.2 miles.*
7. **3/15 – dinner:** Ellwood’s after THATcamp. *1.3 miles.*
8. **3/15 – wild card:** a trip to The National after dark with Andy to see the Drive By Truckers. Blinky-ass lights for both of us. *6.5 miles.*
9. **3/16 – personal health:** rode with Claire to and from the start of the course for our run this morning. *5.0 miles.*
10. **3/16 – groceries:** easy ride down to Kroger with the panniers for my weekly grocery run. *1.3 miles.*
11. **3/19 – work:** rode out to the office after 2 days of snow and ice. *3.2 miles.*
12. **3/19 – reading:** took a side trip to one of my favorite watering holes to dig in to Ed Peeples’ new book, [Scalawag](http://www.amazon.com/Scalawag-Southerners-Journey-Segregation-Activism/dp/0813935393). *0.9 miles.*
13. DONE!

## 3/20: Reflections

12 errands, 9 days, 43.4 miles.

This challenge was a little harder to complete than I thought it’d be. I ride my bike a lot, but usually for the same thing (schlep to work. Schlep to groceries. Schlep to dinner *sometimes*.) This challenge required me to just get out more and do more things in general, not just on two wheels. Last Friday, I took myself out to coffee before work, something I would not do without some sort of external motivator. That day was a really great, productive day at work. During my coffee stop, I was able to plan out a workshop I was leading that afternoon and felt like I was more prepared when I got into the office.

The challenge reminded me that variety is good, that I can always wheel an extra half a mile or so off my normal path and change the course of my day.
