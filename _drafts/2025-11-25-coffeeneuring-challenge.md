Bikes! Coffee! Fall colors! After last year's far-too-fun [return to coffeeneuring]({{site.baseurl}}/coffeeneuring-challenge-fall-2024/), I eagerly awaited [this year's challenge](https://chasingmailboxes.com/2025/09/29/coffeeneuring-challenge-2025-youre-only-15-once/) from Chasing Mailboxes.

## WTF is coffeeneuring?

A riff on randonneuring, coffeeneuring is, at its core, riding your bike to a place to drink coffee. This year’s challenge was as follows:

> Between October 11 through November 24, 2025:
> 
> - ride your bike 7 times,
> - to at least 6 different places
> - at least 2 miles round trip every time
> - drink 7 total cups of coffee (or another fall-type beverage),
> - and document your coffeeneuring

I’ve done similar challenges in past years:

- [2014 Errandonnee challenge]({{site.baseurl}}/errandonnee-winter-bike-challenge/)
- [2016 Errandonnee challenge]({{site.baseurl}}/2016-errandonnee-challenge-handled-it/)
- [2024 Coffeeneuring challenge]({{site.baseurl}}/coffeeneuring-challenge-fall-2024/)
