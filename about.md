I've been making websites since 1998 and am still thrilled by the promise of hypertext. I believe strongly in inclusive, [accessible](/tag/a11y/) design for all humans. 

I live in [Providence, RI](/tag/providence/), with my wife and two extremely cute dogs. I will likely talk with you at length about how we can all get free, being from the South, or riding [bikes](/tag/bikes/).

## work-wise...
...I'm living my long-time dream of working in [civic tech](/tag/civic-tech/), serving as an [information architect](/tag/ia/) and governance specialist for a large dot-gov website. For many years I led digital strategy at a large academic [library](/tag/libraries/), then moonlighted for a year as a director of product at a diversity and inclusion consultancy. 

On the side, I run a small consultancy, [Humans Make Tech](https://humansmake.tech/), to help small organizations maintain, repair, and rebuild their websites.
