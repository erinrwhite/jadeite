## Past projects

### 2023-present: Freelance work as Humans Make Tech
Taking on the rewarding, weird, confounding, educational challenge of web maintenance and repair for small businesses and organizations. My bread and butter is working with clients to make their existing websites better, rather than doing wholesale web redesigns (though sometimes that is in fact the best route). 

Working with a variety of content management systems from Squarespace to self-hosted Wordpress, Wix to Kinsta, Pantheon to homegrown PHP, I've served as web developer, designer, accessibility specialist, UX writer, technology strategist, and more.

### 2020: Trans-inclusive system, services, spaces
I led a Gender-Inclusive Workgroup to explore how VCU Libraries can better serve trans and gender-nonconforming users and staff. The group’s recommendations covered library spaces, staff, computer systems, services, and culture.

Key recommendations included highlighting existing all-gender restrooms; building more gender-inclusive restrooms; expanding availability of menstrual products and disposal bins; continuing support for name-of-use changes in library systems; minimizing display of legal name in library systems; offering ongoing staff training in gender-inclusive language and customer service; and encouraging staff to share pronouns.

### 2017: Redesigned vendor search tool for VCU Libraries
Leveraging quantitative analytics including query logging and heatmapping, we developed a new design for VCU Libraries Search (our instance of a vendor's discovery system). The guiding design principles behind this project:

- Mental models: Bring elements of the search interface in line with other modern, non-library search systems that our users are used to. In our case, we looked to e-commerce websites as a model for some search design patterns. The context is not a perfect 1:1 match, but the comparisons proved useful.
- Aesthetic Integrity: make the visual design more coherent, consistent, and attractive.
- Progressive disclosure: make the system more approachable for novice users by simplifying the interface, while keeping options for advanced users available on demand. The Apple Human Interface Guidelines explain this concept well.
