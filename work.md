## Past projects

## 2025: Malicious compliance gender patterns
*The US's new administration provided some guidance about [asking our users about their sex](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/) (not gender!). But are they really being specific enough?*

I presented some ways that we might ask for our users' sex/gender on our forms in order to comply with new EOs. (Design, content, and code by me.)

### 2024: Design systems for VA.gov
My VA.gov Design System contributions include guidance for breadcrumbs, user flows, content types, page metadata, URL standards, information architecture principles, contributing to documentation, and accessibility testing.

### 2023-present: Freelance work as Humans Make Tech
Taking on the rewarding, weird, confounding, educational challenge of web maintenance and repair for small businesses and organizations. My bread and butter is working with clients to make their existing websites better, rather than doing wholesale web redesigns (though sometimes that is in fact the best route). 

Working with a variety of content management systems from Squarespace to self-hosted Wordpress, Wix to Kinsta, Pantheon to homegrown PHP, I've served as web developer, designer, accessibility specialist, UX writer, technology strategist, and more.

### 2019: *Trans-Inclusive Design* at A List Apart
I wrote about how we can create a more humane web for trans people at A List Apart, the web magazine for people who make websites. Perhaps the highlight of my career.

### 2020: Trans-inclusive library systems, services, spaces
I led a Gender-Inclusive Workgroup to explore how VCU Libraries could better serve trans and gender-nonconforming users and staff. The group’s recommendations covered library spaces, staff, computer systems, services, and culture.

### 2009-2022: Design work at VCU Libraries
At VCU, I was hired as a `Web applications developer` and quickly became UX researcher, UX designer, front-end developer, team lead, digital strategist, and finally, department head. 

Some of my design projects from that time:
- [Back-to-school mobile snapshot](https://erinrwhite.com/back-to-school-mobile-snapshot/)
- [Easier access for databases and research guides at VCU Libraries](https://erinrwhite.com/easier-access-for-databases-and-research-guides-at-vcu-libraries/)
- [A new look for search at VCU Libraries](https://erinrwhite.com/a-new-look-for-search-at-vcu-libraries/)

Some of my other writing from that time:
- [Planning for the most; or, a bellwether speaks](https://erinrwhite.com/planning-for-the-most/)
- [Programmers are not projects: lessons learned from managing humans](https://github.com/erinrwhite/managing-humans)
- [Recruiting web workers for your library](https://erinrwhite.com/recruiting-web-workers/)
- [The UX Moment: A Weave Digital Panel](https://doi.org/10.3998/weave.12535642.0001.203)
